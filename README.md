For the Modern Data Analytics course, we have been provided with a unique dataset as part of the 'Citizen Science' project, which aims to engage citizens closely in scientific research over a three-year period. The selected initiative, 'From Bystander to Hero', is a collaborative effort between the teaching team of Modern Data Analytics and the Faculty of Medicine at KULeuven. The primary goal of this project is to enhance the survival rates of individuals experiencing sudden cardiac arrest by establishing an efficient system where citizens are mobilized to perform CPR while waiting for specialized medical assistance.
For this course, we have been tasked with a specific assignment within this broader project. Our objective is to analyze the current locations of Automated External Defibrillator (AED) devices in relation to the locations of emergency services and the occurrences of cardiac arrests across Belgium. We were asked to identify aspects of the data that we found particularly interesting and worth further investigation, leading us to develop a focused project proposal. 

Project overview
Our starting point was to investigate whether AEDs are placed in locations where there is a high demand for them. Literature indicates that, in case of a cardiac arrest, people should be helped within 3 to 5 minutes in order to have a good chance of survival (Resuscitation Council UK with British Heart Foundation, 2019). Given that emergency responders rarely arrive within this critical time frame, we decided not to incorporate their arrival times into our analysis and directly focus on whether or not there is an AED available close enough in the neighbourhood of the emergency. We acknowledge that placing an AED within a two-minute walking distance for everyone in Belgium is impractical and too expensive. Our project therefore aims to provide a visualization which helps policy makers to place Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) more efficiently.
Our project proposal is comprised of two primary analyses to achieve this goal based on the occurrence of cardiac arrests in a certain area. By addressing geographical constraints and prioritizing high-risk areas, our project aims to enhance the effectiveness of AED deployment, ultimately improving survival rates for cardiac arrest victims. Our final model is tailored to the whole region of Brussels and the most populated city of each province (i.e., Bruges, Gent, Antwerp, Leuven, Hasselt, Mons, Charleroi, Namur, Liege, and Arlon). Therefore, we decided to focus on areas with high cardiac arrest incidence based on the past emergency interventions. To obtain a model that can estimate incidence of cardiac arrest, we used machine learning techniques. This analysis will help us predict areas with a higher likelihood of cardiac arrests, enabling targeted placement of AEDs. 
To bring together the information about the AED placement and cardiac arrest we decided to develop an interactive map that combines information on the occurance of cardiac arrest and available AEDs. Some important factors when it comes to AED availability are the opening hours of the facilities and where the AEDs are stored. This visualization will thus include a time slider to dynamically show the risk of cardiac arrest and will provide information on the location and availability of the AEDs.
